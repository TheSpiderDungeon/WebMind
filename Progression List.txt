This is the reference for the intended progression of the modpack. I've started the general progression to serve as an example of the formatting.

M = Major progression milestone
     The main path of progressing through the modpack. Each new dimension is a major progression milestone.
m = Minor progression milestone 
     Small progression stages that don't directly progress the modpack story, but do contribute to progression. I.E. iron ingots, diamond armor, Create's steam power, Immersive Engineering's
     blast furnace, or whatever other methods of progression we want to lock the story behind that aren't huge events. Major bosses count as minor progression milestones, but are listed separately
     for organizational reasons.
B = Major boss
     Bosses are the major progression milestones of each dimension. Ideally, each major boss has to be defeated to progress to the next dimension, but some minor bosses may work as alternative routes.
b = Minor boss
     Minor bosses are optional bosses or alternatives to major bosses (if listed as such) that can provide the player with extra non-essential gear or access to a new minor milestone.
! = Important note
    This denotes a serious issue or important talking point about something in progression that will have to be dealt with before any major release.


M Overworld
    Pre-Nether
        m Brass (Create mod)
        m Some kind of magic system (Iron's Spells) 
        m Some kind of preliminary tech (Immersive Engineering)
        B Warden
            m Echo Stone

    Post-Nether
        m (Alex's Caves)

    Pre-End
        b Dragons (Ice and Fire)

M Nether
    Unlocked after defeating Warden and activating ancient city portal with an Echo Stone.
    Pre-Aether
        m

    Post-Aether
        m

M Aether
    Unlocked after building an aether portal out of glowstone and activating it with a bucket.
        ! Currently, nothing is preventing the player from obtaining glowstone pre-nether, so aether access will have to be dealt with somehow. Perhaps removing glowstone from loot tables in the overworld?
    m Quartz + Netherite

M End
    B Ender Dragon
