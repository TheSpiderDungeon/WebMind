        - Wooden Elytra
            'SGS'
            'TLT'
            'T T'
            - S = Post-Nether material (currently Stick)
            - G = Glider (IE)
            - T = Tough Fabric (IE)
            - L = Leather
            Reason: Balance. Wooden Elytra requires Collapsible Glider (Immersive Engineering) which requires Aluminum Rods (Immersive Engineering). Sticks will need to be changed to something post-Nether.
