A To Do list for the modpack, as well as a section for suggestions.

TO DO
  Fix drone spawns
  Consolidate metals, tools, armors, etc.
  Reduce damage of "Stress" starter pistol from 7 to 4
  Reduce mining speed of flint tools
  Blacklist Alex's Caves biomes from the Explorer's Compass
  Disable Railgun (Immersive Engineering)
  Disable the Drone Constructor or whatever it's called
  Reduce Warden's health and damage
  Change Echo Stone recipe to include Warden Tendril
  Remove Stone Sword from Wither Skeleton loot table because honestly fuck that
  Mechanical Crafter recipe for the Elytra
  Add Cataclysm eyes to the End Remastered eye recipes to reduce confusion
  Make tools harder to craft
    Currently, I think most things don't lose durability, which I think could be be fun to work around, but I don't know what caused it.
  Test out Tinker's Construct for progression
  Replace Ice and Fire's Raw Silver with Immersive Engineering's
  Add alternative recipe to Diving Helmet and Diving Boots so copper armor isn't a waste
